<h1> LanPlot </h1>

<h3> Introduction </h3>

LanPlot is a new programming language designed to find and plot the Fourier Transform of a given signal. Fourier Series are used to approximate in a periodic way any signal, and its transform is a decomposition of that same signal into frequencies. The motivation for designing this language was to make it easier to visualize the behavior of different signals used specially in communications. LanPlot will be able to take expressions expressed as signals or variables, compute their Fourier Transform, and plot them. A projection for this language is to make possible to plot the square, sawtooth, and triangle Fourier Series approximations of different signals accordingly.
